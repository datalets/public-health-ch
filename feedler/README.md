# Feedler

This is a module for Wagtail that integrates with the [Feedly API](https://developer.feedly.com/) to bring aggregated information sources (blogs, feeds, news, etc.) onto our website. You can see how it works by looking at the *News*, *Events* and *Jobs* sections of the [public-health.ch](https://public-health.ch) home page. Behind the scenes, the service allows administrative staff to look for and moderate incoming articles, and easily prepare them for publication. 

After importing them from Feedly, the posts can be conveniently edited (primarily to fix formatting issues or add images) at anytime through Wagtail's interface.

If there is interest from the community, we could pull this out to be an independent module.
